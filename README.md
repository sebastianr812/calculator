My goal for this project is to connect all of my fundamnetal knowledge of javascript to create a calculator. I will combine DOM manipulation, with functions, conditionals, variable control to get this as a working calculator. This project is the most complex of them all and I would love to be able to see the progress I was able to make throughout taking this course. I am excited for what is to come as I know this is just the beginning. The goal is to fully grasp how different functions or methods change the given output. I know this is just the beginning, but it is a big project compared to when I started, I am so excited to see what more complex things I can create.
